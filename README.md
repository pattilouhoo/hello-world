# hello-world
One day I was walking down one of those busy roads covered with car dealerships (this
was shortly after my wedding was called off) and I found an orphaned dog on the road.
A wooly, black dog with greenish red eyes. I was kind of feeling like an orphan myself,
so I took a couple balloons that were tied to a pole at the dealership and I relocated
them to the dogâ€™s collar. Then, I decided he would be my dog. I named him Bigelow.
